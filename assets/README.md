# Assets

This folder contains raw supporting assets for the addon, such as the logo and screenshots.

## Logo

The logo is made from two Adobe Illustrator files containing the background, and the graphics and text. The Photoshop file is used to compose the logo from the Illustrator files, and Paint.NET is used for final touches e.g. gradients.

The following steps are used to compose the logo from the Photoshop file using Paint.NET:

- Magic wand with 50% tolerance
- Use gradient `#1194F0` to `#003B6F` for GM logo
- Use gradient `#003B6F` to `#0A6FBB` for text

## Screenshots

These screenshots are used on the Steam Workshop page. They are converted to JPG as there is a 2MB file size restriction. Conversion is done using Paint.NET with the following JPG quality settings:
- Quality: 99
- Chroma Subsampling: 4:4:4 (Best Quality)
